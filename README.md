# state_management_flutter
This repo is about #Flutter_StateManagement. There are multiple state management options available in flutter.
Each State Management solution has its own characteristics and each person has different preferences. 

You need to understand which options best fit in your project. I’m not covering theory part as lot’s of post already available. In this demo we will just go with practical.

Available Options:

Pros & Cons

Reason for this Demo:
I have found lot’s of demo but in complex manner and have bit more features. I just try to make as simple as possible way to understand #StateManagement.

So, Guys I try to create very simple demo of #state_management. In this demo I have used 4 different options for same functionality. So it will easy to understand for #flutter_beginners.\
1.setState  
2.Provider  
3.InheritedWidget  
4.Bloc_Pattern  

Below will added soon...  
-Redux\
-MobX\
-GetX\
-Riverpod
